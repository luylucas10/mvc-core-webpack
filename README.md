# ASP.NET Core MVC + Webpack Template

The goal of this project is build an example of how to integrate **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** with **[ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.1)**. This project has configuration for: build sass, transpile es6 to es5, HMR for update front-end files while debugging and production builds too. 

The roadmap:
-
- [x] Build a asp.net core web project with ef core;
- [x] Configure *webpack* for build the front-end (ES6, Sass);
- [x] Make a simple crud API;
- [x] Create a front-end with BS4 and jQuery;
- [x] Create a no SPA front-end with Vue.js and Bulma;
- [ ] Create a no SPA  front-end with Angular and MaterializeCSS;
- [ ] Create a no SPA front-end with React and MaterialUI;
- [ ] Apply Typescript to Vue, Angular and React code;
- [ ] Create an SPA for Vue;
- [ ] Create an SPA for Angular;
- [ ] Create an SPA for React;
- [ ] Add asp.net identity core;
- [ ] and more...

To run this project, you'll need:
 - VS 2019 | NPM/Webpack Task Runner;
 - Node (I'm using 14.4.0);
 - SQL Server (or another database, but you'll need to configure EF configs and recreate migrations);
