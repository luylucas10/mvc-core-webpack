# ASP.NET Core MVC + Webpack + Vue (and what you want)

The goal of this project is build an example of how to integrate **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** 
with **[ASP.NET Core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-3.1)**
using **[BS5](http://getbootstrap.com/)** and **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** for front-end.
This project has configuration for: 
- build sass;
- transpile esnext to es5;
- development and production builds; 

To run this project, you'll need:
 - VS 2022 with NPM/Webpack Task Runner;
 - Node (I'm using 18);
